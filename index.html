                <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                <p>Hi, my name's Leonardo and I'm an high school student that really likes computers. Well that's an understatement, but you got the point. I started
                    playing with programming languages in 9th grade (prima superiore for my fellow Italians out there reading). I started off with python and since then
                    continued studying computer science and many of it's branches in detail. Languages aside, I've got a pretty good knowledge of NT and Posix systems.
                    I'm also into project management and, as you can view later below, tried to apply my knowledge to some fun projects with some friends. That said,
                    coding and computer science aren't my only interests. I've got a lengthy list of things I like and experienced, but ain't gonna list it here :D.
                    Just ask me! (useful contacts and links are at the bottom of the page)

                    <h3>Lolimpo</h3>
                    <p>It is a Discord community where I run the entire IT stack. I developed websites, bots, apis, configured the
                        entire vps and self hosted a git service to host our source code. I currently manage the development team and continue
                        development of websites and bots that I maintain.

                    <h3>Controlli</h3>
                    <p>Many multiplayer games are infested by cheaters. In some of them, there are communities dedicated to detecting a cheat on somebody else's
                        computer, by just logging in with anydesk. That's what screenshares (controlli cheats in italian) are in gaming. That site is meant to
                        host a bunch of useful resources, links and a guide that contains just about everything related to Minecraft screensharing techniques.

                    <p>During high school, I wanted to have a bit of extra fun with some assignments, so here are some of them
                        I decided to actually host. These websites were made in a rush and are designed to make a professor happy.
                        No actual UX, UI design and proper responsiveness are utilized. These websites won't receive future maintenance.</p>
